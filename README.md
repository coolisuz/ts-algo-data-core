### Big O Notation

*Big O notation* is used to classify algorithms according to how their running time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.
On the chart below, you may find the most common orders of growth of algorithms specified in Big O notation.

Below is the list of some of the most used Big O notations and their performance comparisons against different sizes of the input data.
